# Arch-Hausmeister
A simple bash script to clean up clutter from pacman and pacaur

This script will remove unneeded packages and cache files to free up some disk space
The script assumes you're using pacaur to manage your aur packages

root privileges will be needed. Do only use, if you know what you're doing.
I take no liability for any unwanted effects.
